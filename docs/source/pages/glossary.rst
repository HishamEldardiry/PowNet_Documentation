**8. Glossary**
===============

**Generation Mix:** refers to the combination of the various fuels used
to generate electricity in a given geographic region.

**Grid Dispatch:** refers to the process by which transmission system
operators decide which power plants and generation facilities to deploy
to meet current electricity demand.

**Unit Commitment:** determines when and which generating units to
start-up and shut-down.

**Economic Dispatch:** establishes the amount of power supplied by each
unit.

**Susceptance:** represents how much circuit is susceptible to
conducting a changing current or simply how much circuit allows the
changing current.

**Derating Factor:** refers to a reduction factor applied to the nominal capacity or rating of a component, 
such as a generator, transformer, or transmission line, to account for operating conditions or 
constraints that may limit its performance such as temperature, humidity, altitude, loading, and system configuration. 
These deviations can affect the performance and capability of power system components.

**N-1 Criterion:** a reliability criterion used in power systems to ensure grid reliability by assessing the system's ability to 
withstand the loss of a single component without causing a widespread blackout or cascading failures.

**Spinning Reserve:** refers to the excess generating capacity that is immediately available and synchronized to the grid (but is not currently generating energy) to meet unexpected increases in electricity demand or compensate for sudden generator or transmission line outages.
